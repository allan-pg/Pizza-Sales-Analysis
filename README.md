## About this project  
As an Analytics Consultant for a pizza sales shop. I have been asked to build a high-level KPI report for the Executive team, based on the sales records. The purpose of the report is to give stakeholders visibility into the shopâ€™s recent performance.  

## About the Dataset  
The synthetic dataset contains pizza sales records from january to december for the year 2015. It has over 48,000 rows and 12 colums on quantity of pizza sold, time of sale, price of pizza and dates of whole yaer.

## The Data Cleaning and Transformation
The dataset was relatively clean but required some adjustments and transformations to make it suitable for analysis and to generate more comprehensive insights. The following transformations were made:

**Date Adjustments:** order date was not in date format i converted it to date type and from order date i extracted month name and day name
- Mont_name - i extracted month name from order date
- Day_name - Day name was also extracted from order time
- Morning/Afternoon - i extracted this from order time in our table 

## Data Visualization and Analysis
To derive the best insights from this analysis, I created a two-page report covering an overview and pizza`s sold.
